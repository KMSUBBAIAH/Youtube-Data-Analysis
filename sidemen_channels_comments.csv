Naturally I was attracted to the bright green drink and proceeding to nail it. I got through mayb 70% of the bottle until noticed by its owner and how thats his special absinthe 80% vol or something and I wasn't even gone yet. Next thing I know I get sucker punched badly by random in the group. Apparently he got £20 to wack me over the absinthe. \n\n3x resisting arrest in 06 during world cup. 3x in 6wks two weeks apart evenly it wasn't funny in the magistrates but they had a giggle and slapped my wrist so that was OK in the end. I got drunk on the atmosphere more than the drunk then the next thing police officers are grabbing at me. Nope. \n\nTo inlaws who really did not like me im sure they would try to get me drunk in their home and then set upon me. Tell me all the things they think of me. At 2am raining heavy and msyb 3hr walk home. 45min by car. So I had to sit and listen. \n\nLuckily I just could never get drunk around the inlaws the moment I finish a Stella they pass me another.  But I never lost composer around the inlaws. \n\nThese days I dont really drink it still sends me wild if im in a wild setting especially. But when I do drink at home I can drink a full bottle of jack daniels with cans of pop. Burn your lips off then have a nice refreshing sip on sprite/7up for me. Mayb dandelion burdock for you though\nMayb some Dr pepper. But then ill drink heavily for awhile then abruptly stop drinking altogether and just focus on the weed again. \n\nWeed is just so so much better than drink. I know I can go and buy as much weed as I can carry and it will be fine. I'll wake up tomorrow fine. Ill have smoked a clump but not much money really. \n\nVs drink. \n\n3-4 bottles of whiskey in 12hrs window and nobody knows what will happen I don't know what I will be waking up mixed up in. Been there! Skin of teeth escape thing. No thanks drinking is just a bad idea bcos you tell yourself ill only drink x amount but once you feel a buzz you just want more and more. \n\nIt costs £450 minimum this was years ago data too actually just to call out a British ambulance. A very tiny fraction of the pie are pot heads calling an ambulance because they are being sick everywhere. Sleeping in the gutter coverd in sick. Big problem for drinkers. Nevermind all the other taxes paid out for drunken dumb. Ambulances for violence. Violence on the ambulance criminal damage. Criminal damage of your car just cos its parked in the street and drunk wanted to flying kick something to impress his friends. \n\nGuy once head butted my dads windscreen walking home drunk with his wife. He was our friendly neighbour too Luckily so he was very sorry and paid for it to be fixed. My dad was his connect on the old hashish too. He was a cool guy, but a nasty drunk. \n\nThats the most stupid law in UK. No to cannabis, Yes to drink. \n\n\nHow is it worse for a kid to say my dad smoke reefer miss, yeah he chuggs bongs. Than it is for a kid to say my dad drinks alot miss. Yeah he falls all over the house whilst we laugh at him until bedtime. Then he screams at mommy all night. \n\nMy dad wasn't a drinker at all non of my family were drinkers. Many were hash smoker's back in the 90s mid 00s but after the 10s hash became a rare treat around my areas. Its all bud now. Which was a very rare treat when I was a teen. I never saw green. Only solids. Solids they got from my dad and let me hang with them thinking ide sneak steal free stuff but I knew better than to try any of that silliness with my dad.""]"
